Word: tide
Definition: prep.: Time; period; season.; prep.: The alternate rising and falling of the waters of the ocean and of bays rivers etc. connected therewith. The tide ebbs and flows twice in each lunar day or the space of a little more than twenty-four hours.

A high tide upon one side of the earth is accompanied by a high tide upon the opposite side. Hence when the sun and moon are in conjunction or opposition as at new moon and full moon their action is such as to produce a greater than the usual tide called the spring tide as represented in the cut. When the moon is in the first or third quarter the sun's attraction in part counteracts the effect of the moon's attraction thus producing under the moon a smaller tide than usual called the neap tide.; prep.: A stream; current; flood; as a tide of blood.; prep.: Tendency or direction of causes influences or events; course; current.; prep.: Violent confluence.; prep.: The period of twelve hours.; v. t.: To cause to float with the tide; to drive or carry with the tide or stream.; n.: To betide; to happen.; n.: To pour a tide or flood.; n.: To work into or out of a river or harbor by drifting with the tide and anchoring when it becomes adverse.
